</ul>
Chronic loneliness could increase the demand on NHS services including A&amp;E this winter, unless more help reaches older people.

In a new  survey, The Campaign to End  Loneliness estimates nearly 2.5m people over 60 (16%)<b> </b>would not know where to go for help if they were feeling lonely, and predicts it is likely to worsen with nearly 1 in 5 (19%) over 60 year olds expecting to be lonely as they get older.

</ul>
One in five people aged 60 and over who experience loneliness say they have no one to turn to, according to a new poll published today.

The Campaign to End Loneliness, who published the survey is <a href="http://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/threat-to-health/">warning</a> that loneliness and isolation are as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day and is calling on local authorities to take the lead on reducing and preventing loneliness in their local areas.

The organisation says a range of support is needed to overcome the ‘many triggers’ of loneliness faced in older age. The Campaign states that the support needed should include transport and technology – with 41 per cent of those who feel lonely saying transport is a barrier to seeing people, and half (51%) of older people polled believing the internet can help prevent loneliness.

</ul>
David Cameron will need to take bolder steps than any previous leader to deal with a rapidly ageing population.  And the Prime Minister and new government must deliver on its promise of security and dignity for people in retirement.

That’s according to an open letter to the Prime Minister signed by sixteen organisations concerned about the needs of our ageing society including the charity Independent Age, the International Longevity Centre - UK, Anchor, the National Council for Palliative Care, the United Kingdom Home Care Association and the Campaign to End Loneliness .

</ul>
Loneliness ‘maps’ are needed to help local charities and public services find and support those experiencing, or most at risk of, loneliness, according to a new report published today.

Hidden Citizens: how can we identify the most lonely older adults?, published by the Campaign to End Loneliness and University of Kent says local services and councils should use existing data to predict where the most lonely and isolated residents live – allowing limited resources to be targeted at the people and places that need them most.

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Despite a growing recognition of the substantial public health implications of loneliness and the urgent need to take action, there is a significant knowledge gap among funders and commissioners about what really works in addressing it.</span></p>
