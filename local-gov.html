<p>The Campaign has produced several resources designed to help local government find ways to tackle loneliness in their locality.  Whether you are member of a health and wellbeing board, a clinical commissioning group (CCG), adult social care or public health team, this information is relevant to you.</p>

<h3>Hidden Citizens: Executive Summary</h3>

<strong>Hidden Citizens: Research Report</strong>

<p>In 2015, the Campaign to End Loneliness and the <a href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/">University of Kent</a> undertook a piece of research to explore what was already known in both research and practice about identifying people experiencing loneliness. We looked at current approaches to identifying loneliness and searched for insights into how services can improve their outreach and support.</p>

<p>Links to the results of this project - <strong><em>Hidden Citizens: How can we identify  the most lonely older adults?</em> </strong>- are above (both the Executive Summary and full research report, which can be downloaded by clicking on the title links)</p>

<h3>Promising Approaches to Reducing Loneliness and Social Isolation in Later Life</h3>

<p>This report offers some practical answers to what works in tackling loneliness drawing on practical experience and academic evidence. The report argues that leaders in health and social care must recognise the individual’s experience of loneliness and should not seek a ‘one size fits all solution’.</p>

<p>The report sets out a new framework for understanding how to tackle this multifaceted problem, presenting a range of projects and examples from around the country. These examples demonstrate some of the varied solutions needed for an effective response.</p>

<h3>Combating Loneliness - A Guide for Local Authorities</h3>

<p>This resource, produced in partnership with the Local Government Association, offers a brief summary of key research on the issue of loneliness, and some practical steps every local authority, working in partnership with other local actors, can take to tackle the problem.</p>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<h3>Why should local government take action on loneliness?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All those in local government, who are responsible for health and wellbeing, need to recognise the very negative impact that loneliness can have on the population.</li>
  <li>Local government has an important leadership role to play in addressing this issue and should act alongside the many organisations across our communities who are already working to tackle lonelines</li>
  <li>It is important that the new leaders of our health, housing, environment and social care systems recognise the importance of placing loneliness and isolation alongside the standard menu of public health challenges as urgent and in need of action.</li>
  <li>By combating loneliness, councils can diminish the vulnerability of older residents as well as improve and sustain a quality of life across their locality.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are committed to improving quality of life for older residents in your local area, </strong>we invite you to<strong> </strong>become a supporter today. As a supporter, you will stay informed on the latest research and initiatives that tackle loneliness in older age, learn from our work with health and wellbeing boards and be part of a wider network of organisations, individuals and authorities who are committed to ending loneliness.</p>

            <p>Christmas must prompt a new look at lonelinessNovember 3, 2015
            As another Christmas approaches and the Third Sector gears up their efforts to ensure that those facing isolation and loneliness are supported at such an important time, a worrying trend appears to be emerging. Faced with the fact that, as our new research has found, some 2.5 million people over 65 wouldn’t know where to go… </p>
