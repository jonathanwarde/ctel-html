       <h3>What we do</h3>

      <p>Evidence-based campaigning to commissioners: Much of our time is spent campaigning: communicating with, convincing and persuading those who make choices about health and care spending to tackle and prevent loneliness. We provide a strong voice to commissioners of services and activities at a local and national level. We invite our supporter network of 2500+ organisations and people to campaign with us.</p>

      <p>Facilitate learning on the front line: The Campaign to End Loneliness offers organisations who want to tackle loneliness a chance to learn from each other. We provide the latest research, opportunities to meet through events, and regular information to share the motivation and momentum behind this issue.</p>

      <p>Building the research base: We gather together and offer to policy makers and practitioners the latest evidence on loneliness and isolation. We draw on research through our Research Hub which engages academics and specialists from across the world. With these academic partners, we work to make new research as relevant and practical as possible for organisations that are working directly to support older people, or making commissioning decisions.</p>

            As another Christmas approaches and the Third Sector gears up their efforts to ensure that those facing isolation and loneliness are supported at such an important time, a worrying trend appears to be emerging.
